    "# Expense Claim Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create agents that use plugins to process travel expenses from local receipt images, generate an expense claim email, and visualize expense data using a pie chart. Agents dynamically choose functions based on the task context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. OCR Agent processes the local receipt image and extracts travel expense data.\n",
    "2. Email Agent generates an expense claim email.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a travel expense scenario:\n",
    "Imagine you're an employee traveling for a business meeting in another city. Your company has a policy to reimburse all reasonable travel-related expenses. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of potential travel expenses:\n",
    "- Transportation:\n",
    "Airfare for a round trip from your home city to the destination city.\n",
    "Taxi or ride-hailing services to and from the airport.\n",
    "Local transportation in the destination city (like public transit, rental cars, or taxis).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accommodation:\n",
    "Hotel stay for three nights at a mid-range business hotel close to the meeting venue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meals:\n",
    "Daily meal allowance for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, based on the company's per diem policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Miscellaneous Expenses:\n",
    "Parking fees at the airport.\n",
    "Internet access charges at the hotel.\n",
    "Tips or small service charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documentation:\n",
    "You submit all receipts (flights, taxis, hotel, meals, etc.) and a completed expense report for reimbursement."
