## Event Name: Prompting is the New Scripting: Meet GenAIScript

## Description

jQuery once made web development easier by abstracting away complexities, allowing developers to focus on building rather than battling browser quirks. Today, AI development faces a similar challenge. New patterns emerge constantly and keeping up can be overwhelming, especially as AI toolsâ€”especially agentic onesâ€” become more powerful and complex. What if you could leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities to automate tasks using simple, familiar JavaScript abstractions? Enter GenAIScriptâ€”a way to integrate AI into your workflow effortlessly, treating prompts like reusable code snippets. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore how GenAIScript makes AI automation agents feel as intuitive as writing JavaScript, helping you streamline repetitive work without the need for deep AI expertise.
